# Welcome to HackLabs CTF 

The entire competition is managed by the HacklabsManager contract. This contract will provide you with the address of each challenge and also keep track of your score in the competition.

The contract will award each successful submission 5 points and some bonus points. Bonus points are higher if you are the first to correctly submit a level.

At the end of the competition, the contract will be paused and everyone will apply to be the winner. The contract will compare the score of every participant and decide on the winner.

Everything will be done on a chain.

Happy hacking!
